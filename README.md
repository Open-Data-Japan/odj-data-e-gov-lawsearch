## Note on the data

The original data is a meta-data rich compilation of the text of the Japanese law in XML format.
However, the raw XML data is more than 3GB in size and is thus not included in this repository.
This data repository is a text-only extraction of that data for use in language models.

The original data is only around a few 100MBs in size and can readily be downloaded from the url above.
A script to download and extract the text data is included in this repository and gives some example of how to process
the original XML data.
