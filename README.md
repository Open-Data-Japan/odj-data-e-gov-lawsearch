## Note on the data

The original data is a meta-data rich compilation of the text of the Japanese law in XML format.
This data repository is a text-only extraction of that data for use in language models.

The original data is only around 100MB in size and can readily be downloaded from the url above.
The script to extract the text data is included in this repository and gives some example of how to process
the data.
